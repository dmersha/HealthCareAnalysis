# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI (Academic Case Study)

This repository contains an academic case study project focused on analyzing hospital efficiency and performance using Power BI. The analysis was conducted for HealthStat, a fictional healthcare consulting firm, using real-world healthcare data.

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to explore key performance indicators in hospital operations—specifically Length of Stay (LOS) and treatment costs —to help identify trends, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis of hospital metrics such as patient admissions, discharge rates, and cost per stay.
- 📉 LOS & Cost Analysis to understand the main factors influencing patient stay duration and expenses.
- 🧮 DAX Measures** used to create dynamic KPIs, such as:
  - Average Length of Stay
  - Average Cost per Stay
  - Efficiency Score by Hospital
- 📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboard designed for decision-makers at HealthStat.
- 🧩 Data Modeling with clean relationships between patients, hospitals, treatments, and outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query (M language)
- Healthcare Dataset (real-world, anonymized)

## 📈 Dashboard Features

- Dynamic filters (e.g., hospital, region, diagnosis type)
- Trend visualizations over time
- LOS distribution and outliers
- Cost analysis by treatment category
- Hospital performance comparison chart


## 🧪 Insights Gained

- A small number of hospitals with high LOS contributed disproportionately to costs.
- Efficiency improved with specialized departments and fewer transfers.
- Key visual patterns showed seasonal trends in patient volume and discharge rates.

## 📚 Usage

To view the dashboard:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. (Optional) Connect to the original data source if prompted.
4. Explore the dashboard interactively.
